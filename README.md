# 📝 SuperTaskList

Super task list is a simple task list app I made to learn react-native. In this app you can create, edit and delete tasks. You can also mark them as done or undone.

To create this project I followed this [Udemy react-native course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-le-guide-complet-reactjs-hooks)

## 🛠️ Installation

To install this project you need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [expo](https://expo.io/) installed on your computer.

Then you can clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## 📲 Usage

To use this app you need to have the [expo app](https://expo.io/tools#client) installed on your phone. Then you can scan the QR code that appears in the terminal or in the browser.
